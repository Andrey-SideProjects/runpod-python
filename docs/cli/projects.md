# Projects

A runpod project is a single folder that contains all the files needed to create and run a serverless worker.

## Convert existing worker to a project

If you already have a worker, you can convert it to a project by navigating to the root of the worker folder and running `runpod project new --init`.

You may need to update the default configuration within `runpod.toml` to match your project structure.
